		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Git/Github</td>
				<td>4/5</td>
				<td>I have pushed a total of 5 repositories onto the Github website. It could use better organization and granularity to better mark my progress</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>SQL Server</td>
				<td>3/5</td>
				<td>After creating a half-dozen tables. I feel confident in my ability to use SQL. However, the more advanced functions could still use some brushing up (WHERE, ORDER BY)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>C# (.NET)</td>
				<td>2/5</td>
				<td>C# is my least confident skill at the moment of writing this. It feels very nuanced in its classes and libraries. Could definitely still use some more experience developing in the C# environment</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Test-Driven Development</td>
				<td>1/5</td>
				<td>Building test cases can be daunting. I could definitely use more experience here.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>EntityFramework</td>
				<td>3/5</td>
				<td>Leveraging the EF foundation to conduct processes in SQL through the C#/.NET framework is a very useful tool that I'm eager to continue learning </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>HTML//CSS</td>
				<td>4/5</td>
				<td>HTML is very friendly and I find it hard to not inspect websites I browse from time-to-time, just to check out what's underneath the hood. I hope to hone my Javascript skills and build personal style-sheets</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Bootstrap</td>
				<td>5/5</td>
				<td>Bootstrap seems like a structured style that I can jive with. </td>
